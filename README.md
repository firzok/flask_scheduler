# Flask Scheduler
[Original] https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 

Configured to make it usable with flask threads.

An in-process scheduler for periodic jobs that uses the builder pattern for configuration. Schedule lets you run Python functions (or any other callable) periodically at pre-determined intervals using a simple, human-friendly syntax.
